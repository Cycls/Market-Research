## 🎯 About The Project

This agent is designed to be your intelligent assistant for market research. Instead of spending hours on manual research, you can simply ask the agent for information on any company, and it will do the hard work to provide you with a comprehensive and structured report.

### ✨ Key Features

-   Researches companies and their competitors.
-   Analyzes market positioning and differentiators.
-   Generates comparison tables with key features and pricing.
-   Provides actionable insights from multiple trusted sources.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The agent uses an advanced mechanism that combines intelligent search with the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver accurate results:

1.  **Understanding the Request**: The agent starts a conversation with the user to identify the target company.
2.  **AI-Augmented Search**: It uses the **Exa.ai API** to perform deep, targeted searches about the company, its competitors, and industry analysis.
3.  **Data Extraction**: It gathers the most relevant content from the top search results.
4.  **Analysis & Generation**: The collected data is sent to the **OpenAI (GPT-4o mini)** model with a precise prompt to summarize, analyze, and organize it into a comprehensive report.
5.  **Report Presentation**: It presents the user with a structured report containing an overview, a list of competitors, a comparison table, and key insights, citing the sources used.
